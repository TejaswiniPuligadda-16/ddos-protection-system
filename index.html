        <h2>Proposed Solution</h2>
        <p>This system provides multi-layered DDoS protection for cloud infrastructure. It includes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Traffic monitoring</li>
            <li>Anomaly detection</li>
            <li>Scrubbing malicious traffic</li>
            <li>Load balancing across servers</li>
            <li>Auto-scaling cloud resources to maintain availability</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="problem-solution">
        <h2>How It Addresses the Problem</h2>
        <p>
            The system protects against DDoS attacks by monitoring real-time traffic, filtering malicious requests, and scaling cloud resources automatically. It ensures the cloud services remain operational even during large-scale attacks.

    <section id="innovation">
        <h2>Innovation and Uniqueness</h2>
        <p>
            This solution is unique due to its combination of machine learning for accurate anomaly detection and the use of scrubbing centers for real-time traffic filtering. The auto-scaling feature ensures that services remain available, even during high-traffic attacks.
